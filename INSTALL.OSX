GstPEAQ - Installation instructions for Mac OS X platform
---------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
* GStreamer 1.0 and its dependencies. This is best obtained from
  http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/ 
  where it is available as a installable PKG packages.

Compilation:
The recommended way to compile GstPEAQ is to use the XCode project in the xcode
directory (tested width XCode 6.0.1). Assuming the GStreamer framework is
installed in the default location, it should work out of the box.

Installation:
The created libgstpeaq.dylib has to be placed in one of the directories where
GStreamer looks for plugins. These are
* $HOME/.local/share/gstreamer-1.0/plugins/
* /Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
in addition to any paths listed in $GST_PLUGIN_PATH.
Alternatively, the --gst-plugin-load option may be used to explicitly specify
the location of the libgstpeaq.dylib.
