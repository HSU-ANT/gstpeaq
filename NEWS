Version 0.7
===========

* Support for GStreamer API version 0.10 has been dropped; only API 1.0 (i.e.
  GStreamer 1.x) is supported.

Version 0.6.1
=============

Bugfix release: The playback-level property reported a wrong value when read.
Setting it to a specfic value worked corectly; also the default was correctly
set to 92dB (although it was incorrectly reported as 28.24dB).

Version 0.6
===========

Important user visible changes:
* Two bugs were fixed where only the first channel of the audio data was used
  during MOV computation. This did change the results on the conformance
  dataset a little bit.
* Both Gstreamer API versions 0.10 and 1.0 are now supported (to be chosen at
  compile time).
