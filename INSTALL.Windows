GstPEAQ - Installation instructions for Windows platform
--------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
* A C compiler that supports C99. For Microsoft Visual Studio, this means
  version 2013 or newer.
* GStreamer 1.0 and its dependencies. This is best obtained from
  http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/ where it is available as
  installable MSI packages.

Compilation:
If using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (or newer), the easiest way to compile
GstPEAQ is to use the solutions/projects in the vs directory, where the
trailing version number in the file names indicates the GStreamer version to
build against. Provided the GStreamer development files have been properly
installed, compilation should work out of the box.

Installation:
The created gstpeaq.dll has to be placed in one of the directories where
GStreamer looks for plugins. These are
* %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEFOLDER%\AppData\Local\gstreamer-1.0\plugins
* C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86\lib\gstreamer-1.0
in addition to the paths specified in %GST_PLUGIN_PATH%.
Alternatively, the --gst-plugin-load option may be used to explicitly specify
the location of the gstpeaq.dll.
Note that the location of the GStreamer DLLs has to be contained in the %PATH%.
